Grant - Softcover (History)

Pulitzer Prize winner Ron Chernow - author of Hamilton,
which inspired the musical - offers a sweeping and dramatic portrait of one of America's most compelling Civil War generals and presidents,
Ulysses S. Grant. With lucidity, breadth, and meticulousness, Chernow finds the threads that bind Grant's disparate stories together,
shedding new light on the man whom poet Walt Whitman described as "nothing heroic...and yet the greatest hero."
